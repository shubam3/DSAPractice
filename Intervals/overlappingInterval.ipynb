    "# **Explanation:**  \n",
    "# Remove `[1,3]`, then the rest `[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]` are non-overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Intuition**\n",
    "# - If two intervals overlap, you remove **one** of them.\n",
    "# - To minimize removals, always **keep the interval that ends earlier** — it leaves more room for future intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a **greedy approach** similar to the activity-selection problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "# 1️⃣ Sort intervals by their **end time** (`intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])`).  \n",
    "# 2️⃣ Keep track of the **end** of the last non-overlapping interval (`prevEnd`).  \n",
    "# 3️⃣ Iterate through each interval:\n",
    "#    - If current interval’s start ≥ `prevEnd` → no overlap → keep it.  \n",
    "#      Update `prevEnd` to this interval’s end.  \n",
    "#    - Else → overlap → increment removal count (`remove += 1`).  \n",
    "# 4️⃣ Return the number of removed intervals.\n",
